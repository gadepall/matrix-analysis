\begin{enumerate}
\item To draw a pair of tangents to a circle which are inclined to each other at an angle of $60\degree$, it is required
to draw tangents at end points of those two radii of the circle, the angle between them should be 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $135\degree$
\item $90\degree$
\item $60\degree$
\item $120\degree$ 
\end{enumerate}
\item Draw two concentric circles of radii 3 cm and 5 cm. Taking a point on outer circle construct the pair of tangents to the other. Measure the length of a tangent and verify it by actual calculation.
\item Draw a circle of radius 4 cm .Construct a pair of tangents to it, the angle detween which is $60\degree$. Also justify the construction. Measure the distance between the centre of the circle and the point of intersection of tangents.
\item Construct a tangent to a circle of radius 4 cm from a point which is at a distance of 6 cm from its centre.
\end{enumerate}
Write True or False and give reasons for your answer in each of the following 
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
\item A pair of tangents can be constructed from a point $\vec{p}$ to a circle of radius 3.5 cm situated at a distance of 3 cm from the centre.
\item A pair of tangents can be constructed to a circle inclined at an angle of $170\degree$.
	\end{enumerate}
